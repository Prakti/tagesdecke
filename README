Tagesdecke - a thin CouchDB access library
==========================================

This library is meant to be a thin access driver for CouchDB, easing most of
the low-level HTTP handling via convenience functions.

The term 'tagesdecke' is the german term for coverlet meant to be lying on a
couch.

The library is currently considered alpha stage, major API changes are going
to occur. You have been warned.
